# 1.18.1 Recommended Install Guide

## Manual Install
1. Navigate to your Minecraft install folder
2. Copy and Paste the following into your Minecraft install folder
   1. mods
   2. resourcepacks
   3. shaderpacks
   4. versions


## Script Install (still questionable)
### Windows
1. Click on "1.18.1 Windows Auto-Installer.bat" to run it
2. Follow the prompt for the Minecraft path; if you don't know your install path, just hit "y" for "yes"
3. The script will copy relevant files and when you open the Minecraft launcher you should have an option for Fabric 1.18.1. Choose this and start Minecraft; the installed mods should then be running.
